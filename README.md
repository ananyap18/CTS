<h3> Problem statementðŸŒ  </h3>

Connected experiences for consumers: How do you ensure that consumers are loyal to brands and will not switch between brands? Brenda is a retail store assistant, working for a large cosmetics retailer. She has been noticing that many of her loyal customers who would buy a certain shade of lipstick or eye shadow have been switching to a rival brand which makes similar shades at a lower price. However, she realizes that her brand has much betterquality products, and would like to provide attractive offers to her customers to retain them. She would like to have solutions for:   <br>        
â€¢ Digitizing the buying cycle of the consumer through D2C (Direct-to-Consumer) <br>
â€¢ Hyper-personalizing consumer experience using insights into individual preferences <Br> 
â€¢ Digital marketing campaigns and loyalty programs<br>

<h3> Our solutionðŸŽ–</h3>
Since the uprise of web3 community, there has been a motivation to convert web2 apps into more secure, scalable and reliable solutions. To solve the above problem, we plan to solve it using blockchain. Doing so would improve the user experience and give preferred content to them, have a direct channel for small business owners and other sellers to diretly connect to the buyers and to have strong profit margins.

<h2>What it doesðŸš€</h2>
The application opens a whole new arena in the ecommerce world. So it functions this way : <br>
1. Upon sign up the user gets the choice to be a buyer or a store owner(some business).<br>
2. If the user chooses to be a store owner, they will have to make a store/brand page.<br>
3. The store page will include store/brand information (location, company based of from,warehouses, authenticity check).<br>
4. This user can then upload 10-30 second videos, demonstrating their products to sell them. They have to provide tags and keywords for a good reach.<br>
5. The second form of user, the buyer will create their own account having their information(name, address, contact).<br>
6. This information will be confidential and will only be shared to the store if the user buys something from a page on the app.<br>
7. This buyer profile will be connected to a wallet. The user can swap their currencies with the app's currency to buy things.<br>
8. The user can either search a product or mindlessly scroll through new content. <br>
9. Upon setting up a buyers profile, the buyer will have latest product on their feed. With time their feed will get customised according to them.<br>
10. Once a buyer likes some product, they will click on the BUY button available in the bottom right of the page. <br> 
11. The button will guiide the user to the checkout cart<br>
12. The checkout cart will be connected to the wallet and the user can buy the product using our currency.<br>
13. The buyers after using the product can review it and other potential buyers can make a decision to buy a product or not.<br>

<h3> Background work ðŸ”´</h3>
This web3 app is an amalgamation of amazon and tiktok, both being very popular in today's time. People today run to amazon immediately for small things and spend most of their time on tiktok / instagram. We are trying to accumulate the best and profitable features from both the apps. <br> 

<h3> Why is it unique?ðŸŽ‰ </h3>
1. No web3 marketplace sells actual physical products.<br>
2. Having a unique currency makes the buying process easier.<br>
3. It is a secure place for both, the sellers and the buyers.
4. The sellers get the money starightaway and the buyers know the sellers are authentic.<br>

<h4>Yes, it delivers the business value as it uses the best features of the two popular apps. If needed, the app can host ads too, to generate more revenue.<br>
